                Since the theme of the Hackathon was to make things with no value, we decided to write a program that would load images slowly. The image loads with a fractal space-filling curve called the 
                <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_curve"> Hilbert curve</a>.
                Because of it's fractal nature, the percent loaded will get closer and closer to 100; however, to load the image completely would take infinite time. <br>
                I wrote the program for the Hilbert curve in JavaScript using nothing but loops and recursion.

                Our code uses a <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain"> Markov Chain </a> to generate new lyrics to a given song from a large text file.
                Given the lyrics to a song, new lyrics are generated with the same syllabic count so that the song can be sung using the new lyrics. We used Yelp reviews to generate the songs but any large text file could be substituted.
